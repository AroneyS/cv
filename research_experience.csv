Work experience program,UQ Institute for Molecular Bioscience,,"March, 2010",Extracting DNA from mouse bones. Learning initial pipetting skills. 
Advanced study program in Science (ASPinS) Research Subject SCIE3011 ,UQ Queensland Alliance for Agriculture and Food Innovation,Prof Robert Gilbert,January-August 2013,"Testing the amount and structure of glycogen in mouse livers at different times after eating through an assay, size-exclusion chromatography and transmission electron microscopy of extracted glycogen."
Research Assistant Position and Summer Research,UQ Queensland Alliance for Agriculture and Food Innovation,Prof Robert Gilbert,January-July 2014,Comparing the glycogen extracted through the traditional sucrose-gradient method to that extracted from formalin fixed samples.
ASPinS Research Subject SCIE3260,UQ Centre for Advanced Imaging,Dr Horst Schirra,February-June 2015,"Writing code in R to estimate individual false-discovery rates across NMR metabolomics data split into columns along the ppm. This allows the amelioration of the multiple testings problem, without relying on a uniform FDR assumption.  "
Bachelor of Science: Honours,Australian Centre for Ecogenomics,Prof Gene Tyson,July 2015-June 2016,"Using the newly developed in-situ chemotaxis assay (ISCA) device to capture bacteria that display chemotaxis towards environmentally relevant compounds, including poly(ethylene terephthalate) degradation products and pesticides (diuron and atrazine).  Then analysing the captured microbes using culture-independent methods (e.g. 16S rRNA gene amplicon and metagenomics) to provide the microbial population attracted by each individual chemoattractant and their metabolic potential.  "
Research Assistant Position,Australian Centre for Ecogenomics,Prof Gene Tyson,June 2016-September 2016,Comparing 1µL sea water samples before and after homogenisation to provide metagenomic data of the microheterogeneity of microbial life at such volumes.

Interdisciplinary Bioscience Doctoral Training Partnership Research Project,Oxford Department of Plant Sciences,Prof Andrew Smith,April-June 2017,Sequencing Portulaca oleracea with Oxford Nanopore MinION technology. This plant performs both CAM and C4 photosynthesis. Extracted and analysed the activity of various phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylases from C3 and CAM photosynthetic plants. 
Interdisciplinary Bioscience Doctoral Training Partnership DPhil Project,Oxford Department of Plant Sciences,Prof Philip Poole,August 2017-Ongoing,"Determining the role of flagellar-based motility and chemotaxis in the symbiosis of Rhizobium leguminosarum with Pisum sativum (pea). Characterising the influence of the metabolic potential of the environment, especially through the phosphor-transferase system, on its swimming ability. "
