intro,"I am a joint author of 3 journal articles {64 total citations} in biochemistry and molecular biology. I have worked in a wide range of research environments, from the biochemistry focussed diabetes laboratory at the Queensland Alliance for Agriculture and Food Innovation, through the plant and bacteria investigations at the Department of Plant Sciences, Oxford University, to the statistical analyses at the Australian Centre for Ecogenomics. I have also constructed a [4000 line analytical dashboard](https://github.com/zooniverse/zoo-stats-api-graphql) with underlying database during an internship with the [Zooniverse](https://www.zooniverse.org/) community science enterprise associated with the Department of Physics, Oxford University. I am currently completing a DPhil on bacterial chemotaxis at the University of Oxford funded by a Clarendon Award.

I am seeking a Postdoctoral Researcher position in microbiology, molecular biology and genomics. I am keen to join a research team and undertake laboratory work in these fields. I am also interested in continuing to use my programming skills for automated statistics and image analysis."
