intro,"I am an author of 3 high-impact journal articles in biochemistry and molecular biology. I have also constructed a [4000 line analytical dashboard](https://github.com/zooniverse/zoo-stats-api-graphql) with underlying database during an internship with [Zooniverse](https://www.zooniverse.org/) while completing a DPhil on bacterial chemotaxis at the University of Oxford funded by a Clarendon Award.

I am currently searching for a Postdoctoral Researcher position in microbiology, molecular biology and genomics. I am also interested in data analysis and statistical programming."
